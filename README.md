## Hey there, welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dmytro Crawford, and I'm currently sudying Computer Science at the University at Buffalo ðŸ“š.

I love to work on websites, algorithms, crypto and creating projects which make
peoples lives easier. I am proficient with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/),
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and C,
amongst others. Currently hacking on React, typically partnered with Next.js and
looking into building extensions for a few different applications. (Raycast, Shopify, Slack, etc)

I still have a lot to learn but I am proud of how far I have come as a developer.
